Aaron, in order to get sync'd up with this github "repo" do the following:
* If you haven't already, [install github](https://desktop.github.com/)
* From the `git Shell` tool that should come with Github, [navigate into a Directory](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) into which you want to put this repo 
* the following command will create a new Directory in whatever Directory your command line is in when you run the command. The directory that is created will be the root of our project. It will be called `SSC`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewmbyrd/SSC.git
```
* There should only be one file in this directory - this README! But oh we'll add to that
